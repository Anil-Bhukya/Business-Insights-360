# Business Insights 360

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to make the purpose and objectives of our data analytics clear. The report will provide detailed views on sales, finances, supply chain, marketing, and overall company performance. This will help answer many questions about how the company is doing and is an important step for not just surviving but succeeding in the industry.

## Company Background

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing company in the computer and accessories market, has expanded its business globally, selling products through retailers, direct sales, and distributors. Recently, the company faced unforeseen losses after opening a store in America based on decisions derived from surveys, intuition, and limited Excel analysis. In contrast, their competitors have robust analytics teams to make data→driven decisions. These setbacks have highlighted the critical need for AtliQ Hardware to establish a dedicated analytics team to provide data→driven insights and decisions, ensuring better survival and competitiveness in the industry.
